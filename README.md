 # ðŸ§© Maintenance Assistant by Team BYOP
 
 Welcome to the **Maintenance Assistant** React application!  
 
 This UI provides an intuitive interface to interact with the backend AI assistant for document understanding, query support, and smart data provider. 
 
 This application is bundled along with the **Maintenance Assistant Extension** as a local browser extension.

 The **Maintenance Assistant Extension** is a lightweight, local-first chatbot that allows users to query asset metadata and document-based data directly from any webpage. It works in sync with your backend APIs and supports toggling between datasource and document query modes.
